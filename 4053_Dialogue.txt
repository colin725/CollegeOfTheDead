*Victor runs toward a group*

Victor
"What happened to you guys?"

Ally (Math major)
"Stay back! Are you a zombie?"

Jack (Jock)
"Really, Ally? Does he look like a zombie?"

Alex
"Hey you never know!"

Jack
"Yes, you do. Zombies aren't hard to point out. A 4-year old could."

Tracy (LA major)
"Go easy on her, Jack. We're all tense here."
"Sorry about that, I'm Tracy. This is Jack and Ally."

Victor
"Don't worry about it. I was afraid of the same thing. I'm Victor. I'm glad I found you guys. Zombie Survival rule number #1: Don't roam alone!"

*zombie moans in the background*

Jack
"Crap! More are coming!"
