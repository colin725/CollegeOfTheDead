-- Outside the building --
(before the first level)

*Victor runs toward a group*

Victor
"Hey, there are others."
"What happened to you guys?"

Ally (Science major)
"Stay back! Are you a zombie?"

Jack (athlete, Math major)
"Really, Ally? Does he look like a zombie?"

Ally
"Hey you never know!"

Jack
"Yes, you do. Zombies aren't hard to point out. You know rotting flesh, missing body parts, go "uuuuuhhhhhhh". A 4-year old can point one out."

Tracy (LA major)
"Go easy on her, Jack. We're all tense here."
"Sorry about that, I'm Tracy. This is Jack and Ally."

Victor
"Don't worry about it. I was afraid of the same thing, actually. I'm Victor. I'm glad I found you guys. Zombie Survival rule number #1: Don't roam alone!"

Jack
"Zombie survival rules? What?"

*zombie moans in the background*

Jack
"Crap! More are coming!"

-- Front of the schoolyard --

Victor
"So where were you guys when all this happened?"
"A few students and I ran out of class when our teacher turned into a zombie."

Jack
"I was headed to the computer lab."

Tracy
"I was getting off the bus."

Ally
"I was coming back from a class."

Victor
"Sounds like nowhere on campus is safe..."

Ally
"How are we going to survive this?"

Victor
"Zombie Survival rule #7: Don't panic."

Jack
"Again with the rules?"

Tracy
"Don't worry about it, Jack. Let's keep moving."


-- Outside school, in town --


Tracy
"Looks like the streets are deserted..."

Ally
"At least the street lights are on."

*zombies moan in the distance*

Jack
"They're this far out?"

Victor
"We gotta get out of here."


-- Into the forest --

Ally
"No."

Jack
"What?"

Ally
"No. No way I'm going into a dark forest in the middle of a freaking zombie invasion!"

Tracy
"We could try the other side of the campus. The highway will only be a few miles from there."

Victor
"It's too far. We'll be dead before we get halfway. Cutting through the forest is probably our best bet."

Jack
"Don't think we have much choice."

Victor
"Ok then. Let's go."

Ally
"Oooo!"

Tracy
"Don't worry. You'll be fine. We got you."


-- Out of the forest -

Ally
"I don't think I can go on guys..."

Victor
"Zombie Survival rule number #25: Never give up."

Jack
"Will you shut up? We've been walking for miles. I'm tired."

Tracy
"Leave him alone, Jack. Besides, we could use some moral."

Ally
"And some food."

Jack
"You don't like taking my side, do you Tracy? They're stupid rules."

Victor
"At least they're relevant..."

Jack
"Shut up...The likelihood of this happening was 1 in 10 million. It was obviously written by a zombiephobic nutjob."

Victor
"Hey, that's my father your talking about!"

Jack
"Seriously? Tell me your joking."

Victor
"Yeah I am. But clearly this guy isn't much of a nutjob now."

Ally
"Who cares I just want something to eat!"

Tracy
"Guys, look! We made it to the docks. There's another boat... and some zombies in the way."


Victor
"Only one way to find out. Zombie Survival #26: Take risks when necessary."


Ally
"The zombies look tough though. And it doesn't seem like they're moving..."

Victor
"We don't have a choice then. We can wait here and get eaten by them or other zombies or we can go down fighting. I'm not doing the first. Whose with me?"

Jack
"Count me in."

Tracy
"Me too."

Ally
"I guess I'm in too."

Victor
"Alright. Let's do this!"

-- Ending --

Victor
"Got the keys. Who wants to drive?"

Tracy
"I'll do it. We can head to my friend's house in the next city over."

Victor
"Alright. Let's go!"

*They get in the boat*

Later...

Ally
"I thought we'd never get out."

Jack
"Tell me about it. So, what do you guys plan to do now, while the government gets this crap sorted out? I'm gonna sleep."

Ally
"I'm gonna eat lots of food."

Tracy
"I'll probably sleep also."

Victor
"Hug the life out of my family, especially my puppy."
"Zombie Survival rule number 30: Cherish family and friends."
